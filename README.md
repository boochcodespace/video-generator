# Hyperframes Editor — Student Edition

A workbench for building motion-graphics video pipelines in **plain HTML + GSAP**, powered by [Hyperframes](https://hyperframes.heygen.com). Twelve finished video projects you can clone, scrub through, rip apart, and rebuild as your own.

> This is **not** a Remotion / React / Next.js video stack. Every composition in this repo is a regular HTML file with a paused GSAP timeline attached to `window.__timelines`. The Hyperframes CLI handles lint, preview, and render.

---

## Who this is for

Students who want to learn how professional short-form and promo video gets built end-to-end — storyboard, brand system, motion graphics, audio sync, render pipeline — by reverse-engineering real projects. Every project here shipped (or almost shipped). Scrub the compositions, read the HANDOFF/STORYBOARD docs, play the `final.mp4`, then change things and see what breaks.

## Prerequisites

- **Node 20+** — run `node --version` to check
- **FFmpeg** on your `PATH` — needed for audio extraction and re-encoding
- **Chrome (latest)** — Hyperframes renders through a headless Chromium
- **~5 GB free disk** — node_modules is chunky; renders are bigger
- **16 GB RAM recommended** for smooth Studio preview with multiple shader blocks

Run `npx hyperframes doctor` after `npm install` — it reports what's missing.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> hyperframes-editor
cd hyperframes-editor
npm install

# Optional — only if you want to use the ClickUp / OpenAI integrations
cp .env.example .env
# ...then edit .env with your own keys

# Open Studio on one of the included projects
cd video-projects/may-shorts-19
npx hyperframes preview    # http://localhost:3002
```

Studio hot-reloads on file save. Scrub the timeline, inspect scenes, change colors, watch it re-render live.

## The 12 projects, at a glance

Start by opening each `final.mp4` to see the target, then open `index.html` to see how it's built.

### Short-form vertical (9:16, 1080×1920)
| Project | What it is |
|---|---|
| `may-shorts-19` | TikTok-style talking-head + motion graphics + karaoke captions. This one has the most polish — the `/short-form-video` skill was written around it. |
| `may-shorts-18` | Earlier short in the same series. Compare v2 vs may-shorts-19 to see what got refined. |

### Short-form landscape (16:9)
| Project | What it is |
|---|---|
| `may-shorts-6` | Landscape cut of a talking-head short, same production pattern as the vertical series. |

### Product promos
| Project | What it is |
|---|---|
| `clickup-demo` | 60s SaaS product demo — heavy registry-block use (x-post, ui-3d-reveal). Five render versions show the iteration curve. |
| `linear-promo-30s` | 30s Linear-style promo in the Infinite Payments aesthetic. Ships as a draft — finishing it is a good student exercise. See `NOTES.md`. |
| `hyperframes-sizzle` | Hyperframes × Claude Code sizzle reel. Uses the `/website-to-hyperframes` flow. |
| `first-agent-promo` | 32s "Your First AI Agent" launch film. Uses a React-via-Babel approach instead of the standard HTML pattern — a useful counter-example. |

### Educational lessons
| Project | What it is |
|---|---|
| `aisoc-lesson-5-1` | Full lesson video (face-cam + motion graphics). See CLAUDE.md for the new-lesson pipeline (transcribe → word-synced MG → sections). |
| `golden-ratio-demo` | AIS lesson on proportion in layout. Ships as a polished draft — see `NOTES.md` for what was left open. |
| `claude-edit-intro` | Promo-style intro to an editing workflow; minimal brand hardcoding — easy starting template. |

### Brand hype / launch
| Project | What it is |
|---|---|
| `aisoc-hype` | 30s AI Automation Society brand hype film — the scaffold many other AIS projects reference. |
| `aisoc-app-release` | 30s AIS mobile app release promo. Read `HANDOFF.md` — Nate documented every footgun. |

## ⚠️ Customizing for your brand

**This is the most important section.** The repo ships with AI Automation Society (AIS) branding baked in as a worked example. Before you use any of this for your own work, swap these out:

### The global swap list

| File | What it is | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/brand-tokens.css` | Defines `--ais-bg`, `--ais-accent`, `--ais-warn`, font variables | Replace hex values + font families with your own. Consider renaming the custom-prop prefix to your brand (`--acme-bg`, etc.) — but then you'll need to grep every composition for the old names. |
| `assets/AIS Logo PNG.png` | Logo used by AIS projects | Drop your own logo in; either keep the filename so existing references work, or rename and grep-replace. |
| `assets/AIS Background.png` | Background image occasionally used in AIS scenes | Same pattern as logo. |
| `assets/AIS Brand Guideline Small.jpg` | Reference image for the AIS brand | Delete; replace with your own guideline image if you have one. |
| `DESIGN.ais-example.md` | Full AIS brand spec | **Don't edit.** Use it as your template: copy it to your new project folder as `DESIGN.md` and rewrite colors, fonts, motion rules, and "What NOT to Do" for your brand. |

### Per-project AIS coupling

| Project | AIS coupling | Treat as |
|---|---|---|
| `aisoc-hype`, `aisoc-app-release`, `aisoc-lesson-5-1`, `golden-ratio-demo` | **Heavy** — hex values hardcoded in compositions, `@aiautomationsociety` handle, AIS logo glow recipe, Nate's on-camera identity in some scenes | Reference only. Rebuild from scratch for your brand. |
| `clickup-demo`, `first-agent-promo`, `hyperframes-sizzle`, `linear-promo-30s`, `may-shorts-*`, `context-session`, `claude-edit-intro` | **Minimal** | Good starting templates — swap the brand tokens and you're mostly there. |

### Find-and-fix sweep

After you've swapped the global assets, run this grep to find any AIS references still living in compositions:

```bash
# Finds hardcoded hex values and AIS strings anywhere in video-projects/
grep -rEn "(#37bdf8|#f09025|#07121c|#195066|aisoc|AIS Logo|@aiautomationsociety)" video-projects/
```

Replace each hit either with the matching CSS custom prop from your new `brand-tokens.css`, or with your own hex/handle.

## Creating your own new video project

1. Pick a kebab-case name: `mkdir video-projects/my-brand-promo`
2. Scaffold with the CLI or copy a sibling:
   ```bash
   cd video-projects/my-brand-promo
   npx hyperframes init
   ```
   Or, faster: copy the `hyperframes.json` + `meta.json` from a sibling project you like, edit `meta.json` for your new id/name/dimensions, and start on `index.html` from scratch.
3. Install the shared brand assets into your project:
   ```bash
   cp ../../assets/brand-tokens.css assets/
   cp ../../assets/YourLogo.png assets/
   ```
4. Write your `DESIGN.md` (copy the shape of `DESIGN.ais-example.md` from the root).
5. Build. Preview. Lint. Render.

## The authoring loop

```
edit → lint → preview (Studio, live) → draft render → verify frames → final render
```

| Step | Command | What to check |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `npx hyperframes lint` | Zero errors before you preview. Warnings are survivable. |
| Preview | `npx hyperframes preview` | Scrub the timeline, fix anything weird live. Hot reload works. |
| Draft render | `npx hyperframes render --quality draft --output renders/draft.mp4` | ~1–3 minutes. CRF 28 — pixelated but fast. |
| Verify frames | `ffmpeg -ss <t> -i renders/draft.mp4 -frames:v 1 out.png` | Pull one frame per scene at its hero moment. Look for cropped faces, misaligned text, blank frames. |
| Final render | `npx hyperframes render --quality standard --output renders/final.mp4` | Visually lossless 1080p. Ship this. |

> **`MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md` is your aesthetic gym.** Before you build anything, read section 0 (the 10 Laws) and section 4 (pre-flight checklist). This doc is the difference between "it rendered" and "it's good."

## Recommended reading order

1. **This README** (you're here)
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** — full workspace guide, conventions, skills, render contract. Useful even if you're not using Claude Code — the 11 Render Contract rules apply to anyone editing a composition.
3. **`MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md`** — aesthetic rules. Read before brainstorming your first scene.
4. **`DESIGN.ais-example.md`** — worked example of a brand spec.
5. **Pick one generic project** (`claude-edit-intro` is a good start). Open `index.html`, `final.mp4` side by side, and the `compositions/` folder. Read, scrub, modify, re-render.
6. **Then open an AIS project** — you'll have the vocabulary to see how far they push the framework.

## Using Claude Code with this repo

The `.claude/skills/` folder ships a set of slash commands that encode framework-specific patterns (`window.__timelines` registration, `data-*` attribute semantics, shader-compatible CSS). If you use [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), these unlock automatically:

- `/hyperframes` — authoring/editing compositions, captions, TTS, audio-reactive animation
- `/hyperframes-cli` — CLI reference (init, add, lint, preview, render, transcribe, tts)
- `/gsap` — GSAP animation: timelines, easing, stagger, plugins
- `/hyperframes-registry` — install catalog blocks/components
- `/website-to-hyperframes` — turn a URL into a composition (7-step capture-to-video)
- `/make-a-video` — end-to-end beginner flow
- `/short-form-video` — 9:16 talking-head + motion graphics playbook

Not a Claude Code user? The skills are just markdown — open them up and read as documentation.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | First thing to try |
|---|---|
| `npx hyperframes` — command not found | `npm install` in the repo root first |
| Render fails mid-way | `npx hyperframes doctor` — verifies Node, FFmpeg, Chrome |
| Studio preview stuck at 0s | Hard-refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R). If that fails, try a specific sub-composition URL: `http://localhost:3002/?comp=<sub-comp-id>` |
| Lint errors about overlapping clips | Two clips on the same `data-track-index` overlap in time — assign different track indices or adjust `data-start` / `data-duration` |
| Lint errors about `missing_gsap_script` | Every sub-composition HTML needs its own `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14.2/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>` before its IIFE — GSAP doesn't inherit from the parent |
| Video frozen in a render, audio continues | A `<video>` element was animated directly (don't animate `width`/`height`/`top`/`left` on a `<video>`). Wrap it in a `<div>` and animate the wrapper. |
